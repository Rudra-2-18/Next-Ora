          <p>Most local businesses do not fail because they lack quality. They lose growth because their digital presence is inconsistent, unclear, or difficult to manage. The Next Ora builds practical digital systems that help business owners attract better inquiries, respond faster, and convert more leads without unnecessary complexity.</p>
          <p class="small-text">Built for business owners who want clarity, accountability, and steady progress, not confusing reports.</p>

        <h2 class="reveal">What We Actually Do</h2>
        <p class="reveal">Many businesses invest in scattered digital activities without a clear system. We solve that by aligning your website, social visibility, and lead communication into one structured growth engine.</p>
        <div class="problem-grid">
          <article class="card card-hover reveal">
            <span class="icon icon-lg">P1</span>
            <h3>Unclear Online Presence</h3>
            <p>Customers visit your profile or website but cannot quickly understand your value, pricing confidence, or next action. This creates drop-off and low inquiry quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Our solution:</strong> clean messaging architecture, conversion-focused page sections, and strong trust signals.</p>

            <span class="icon icon-lg">P2</span>
            <h3>Inconsistent Lead Handling</h3>
            <p>Inquiries come in, but follow-up is delayed or missed. This directly reduces conversion even when demand exists.</p>
            <p><strong>Our solution:</strong> structured WhatsApp response systems with fast lead routing and practical follow-up flow.</p>

            <span class="icon icon-lg">P3</span>
            <h3>Growth Without Direction</h3>
            <p>Posting regularly is not enough if strategy is unclear. Businesses need measurable social actions tied to business goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Our solution:</strong> monthly Instagram growth plans with content structure, performance reviews, and execution discipline.</p>
